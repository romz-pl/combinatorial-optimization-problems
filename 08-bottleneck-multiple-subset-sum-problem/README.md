## Applications

A real-world problem for (MSSP) from a company producing objects of marble. Every week a shipment of m marble slabs
from a quarry is received by the company. These slabs have a uniform size and are
much longer than wide. The company produces different products, which first have
to be cut from the marble slabs and are then further processed. In particular, each
product requires a piece with a specified length from a marble slab. Depending on
current stock, the company prepares a list of products that it would be interested
to produce. Out of this list, some products should be selected and cut from the
slabs so that the total amount of wasted marble is minimized. This problem was
modeled as a (MSSP) with the slabs corresponding to the knapsacks and the lengths
corresponding to the weights.
