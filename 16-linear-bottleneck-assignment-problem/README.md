# Linear Bottleneck Assignment Problem


## Problem formulation




The problem is formulated as follows:


![Mathematical formulation](./problem.png)


The first set of equations (1) says that every row of a matrix $X = (x_{ij})$ sums to $1$. The
second set of equations (2) says that every column of a matrix $X$ has a sum of $1$.
Finally, (3) says that a matrix $X$ has only the entries $0$ and $1$. In particular,
a matrix $X$ has exactly $n$ 1-entries, one in every row and in every column. The
relations (1)–(3) are called assignment constraints and the matrix $X$ is called the permutation matrix.
