# Subset Sum Problem


## Problem formulation

The Subset Sum Problem is the knapsack problem with $p_j = w_j$. 
The resulting optimization problem is known as the **subset sum problem** because
we are looking for a subset of the values $w_j$ with the sum being as close as possible
to, but not exceeding the given target value $c$.


## Mathematical formulation

A knapsack problem can be formulated as a solution of the following linear integer program:
